## About

This page was created using graphics from [D3.js][d3js]'s force directed layout with SVG, data processing using [Python][python]'s[Networkx][networkx] library and good old fashioned data entry gumption.

You can read more about the technical aspects of implementation on my blog post [here][raoj-blog].
